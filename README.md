# kGraphics #

Just me mucking about with some graphics stuff. My main purpose is to play around with the possibilities of Kotlin and try to design "fluid" classes. This is meant more in a linguistic than algorithmic way. I want to express concepts like Vectors or Meshes in a way, that is both easy to read and effective to use.


## Meshes ##

This is what I am currently concentrated on: Based on HalfEdge data structure I try to create algorithms to reliably create and manipulate Meshes. Have snoop around in the Wiki and hope I had the patience to add some thoughts to what I did in the code.
